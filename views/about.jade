        p Located in Portland, Oregon since 2009, <i>Interactive Balance</i> has been building custom online training software for multi-national companies deploying to over 3,000 properties worldwide. We changed the way HR does business by encouraging paticipation through delegation from corporate to regions to the property level, instead of a single HR unit managing hundreds of thousands of records.  Everyone is responsible for their own departments course completion rates training on various SOPs, tasks, requirments, and expectations.
